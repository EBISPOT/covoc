# Coronavirus Vocabulary

The COVID-19 Vocabulary (COVoc) is an ontology containing terms related to the research of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes host organisms, pathogenicity, gene and gene products, barrier gestures, treatments and more. COVoc concepts and synonyms are used to annotate MEDLINE, PMC and the CORD-19 preprint collection in order to provide navigation from the literature to ELIXIR core databases.
